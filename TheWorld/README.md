# The World

This is a github repo of a pluralsight course i did to learn the basics of asp.net and refresh my basic wed development skills. 

The course can be found here:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnetcore-efcore-bootstrap-angular-web-app/table-of-contents

This course is very basic for the first 5 modules and more of a refresher course (at most) for a web developer with any exsperiance.

Great start point for learning the new asp.net core basic though.
